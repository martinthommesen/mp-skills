Load each named prerequisite by its installed-catalog identity through an eligible skill mechanism exposed by the current host. If none is available, locate it in the installed skill catalog and read its `SKILL.md`, resolving resources from that skill's directory. Check invocation policy before following it: a user-only prerequisite needs the human's explicit invocation. If a prerequisite is missing or inaccessible, report its name and stop the dependent step.

Load `grilling` and follow its interview rules.
